## Description

**ofxOfelia** is ofelia packaged as an openFrameworks addon which enables you to build the external yourself or create a standalone application for macOS, Linux(64bit), Windows(32bit), iOS and Android that can run Pd patches made with ofelia.

## Build Requirements
In order to use ofxOfelia, you first need to download and install openFrameworks 0.9.8 which is the most recent stable release. ofxOfelia is currently not compatible with openFrameworks 0.10.x and it will be updated after the next stable release of openFrameworks. Please follow the [setup guides](http://openframeworks.cc/download/) to download and install openFrameworks 0.9.8. The following tools are used to build ofxOfelia project.

* macOS / iOS : Xcode
* Linux : Makefile.
* Windows : Visual Studio Community 2015.
* Android : Android Studio.

## Setup guide

* Make sure you have openFrameworks setup on your desktop.
* Download [ofxOfelia](https://github.com/cuinjune/ofxOfelia/archive/0.1.0.tar.gz), [ofxPd](https://github.com/danomatika/ofxPd/archive/1.6.1.tar.gz), [ofxMidi](https://github.com/danomatika/ofxMidi/archive/1.0.6.tar.gz) and rename the extracted folders to `ofxOfelia`, `ofxPd` and `ofxMidi`.<br />
Place them within the directory `OF/addons`. ("OF" indicates the base directory of openFrameworks)
* Download [pd-0.48-1 source archive](http://msp.ucsd.edu/Software/pd-0.48-1.src.tar.gz) and find `src` folder inside the extracted directory and copy it into `OF/addons/ofxOfelia/libs/pd`.
* (macOS and Linux) Open the Terminal and run the following to update openFrameworks.
  <pre>cd OF/addons/ofxOfelia/scripts/(targetOS)
  sudo ./updateOF.sh</pre>
* (Windows) Execute the following batch file to update openFrameworks.
  <pre>OF/addons/ofxOfelia/scripts/Win/updateOF.bat</pre>
