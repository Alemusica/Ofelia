## Description
ofelia is a Pd external which allows you to use openFrameworks and Lua within a real-time visual programming environment for creating audiovisual artwork or multimedia applications such as games.

[openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) is an open source C++ toolkit for creative coding.<br />
[Lua](https://www.lua.org/) is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, easy-to-learn scripting language.<br />
[Pure Data](https://puredata.info/)(Pd) is a real-time visual programming language for multimedia.<br />

Thanks to Lua scripting feature, you can do text coding directly on a Pd patch or through a text editor which makes it easier to solve problems that are complicated to express in visual programming languages like Pd. And unlike compiled languages like C/C++, you can see the result immediately as you change code which enables faster workflow. Moreover, you can use openFrameworks functions and classes within a Lua script.

Using ofelia, you can flexibly choose between patching and coding style based on your preference.<br />
For patching style, ofelia currently provides over 300 [openFrameworks](https://github.com/cuinjune/ofxOfelia/tree/master/ofelia/libs/of) and [Pd](https://github.com/cuinjune/ofxOfelia/tree/master/ofelia/libs/pd) abstractions.<br />
You can see a categorized list of abstractions from the [help-intro.pd](https://github.com/cuinjune/ofxOfelia/tree/master/ofelia/help-intro.pd) patch.

The external is available to be used under macOS, Windows, Linux and Raspberry Pi. (64bit only on macOS and Linux)

## Installation
* Make sure you have [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data) installed on your desktop.
* Start Pd and go to `Help` -> `Find externals`, then search for `ofelia`
* Select the latest version of ofelia to download and install.
* Try opening patches inside downloaded `ofelia/examples` directory.
* (Windows) If the library fails to load, open `vc_redist` executable file inside `ofelia` directory to install [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable packages](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads). And if video examples don't work properly, try installing the [K-Lite Codec Pack](https://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm).
* (Linux / Raspberry Pi) If the library fails to load, open the Terminal and run the following command to install dependencies.
  <pre>cd ofelia/scripts/distro_name
  sudo ./install_dependencies.sh</pre>

## Description

**ofxOfelia** is ofelia packaged as an openFrameworks addon which enables you to create a standalone application for macOS, Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi, iOS and Android that can run Pd patches made with ofelia and Pd vanilla objects.

You can share the application with a wide range of audiences including non-Pd users and mobile device users.

## Build Requirements
In order to use ofxOfelia, you first need to download and install openFrameworks. Please follow the [setup guides](http://openframeworks.cc/download/) to download and install openFrameworks. The following tools are used to build ofxOfelia project.

* macOS / iOS: [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
* Linux / Raspberry Pi: [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).
* Windows: [Visual Studio Community 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).
* Android: [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/).

## Setup guide
* Make sure you have openFrameworks setup on your desktop.
* Download [ofxOfelia_targetOS.zip](https://github.com/cuinjune/ofxOfelia/releases/latest) and rename the extracted folder to `ofxOfelia`.<br />
Place the folder within the directory `OF/addons`. ("OF" indicates the base directory of openFrameworks)
* Move `ofxOfelia/libs/ofxLua` folder to `OF/addons`.
* (Linux / Raspberry Pi) Open the Terminal and run the following to update openFrameworks.
  <pre>cd OF/addons/ofxOfelia/scripts/(targetOS)
  sudo ./updateOF.sh</pre>
  
## Building the external

#### macOS
* Open `OF/addons/ofxOfelia/macOSExternal/ofelia.xcodeproj` with Xcode and build the project.

#### Linux / Raspberry Pi
* Open the Terminal and run the following command to build the project. 
  <pre>cd OF/addons/ofxOfelia/(targetOS)
  make

#### Windows
* Open `OF/addons/ofxOfelia/WindowsExternal/ofelia.vcxproj` with Visual Studio and build the solution.
 
Copy the binaries from `OF/addons/ofxOfelia/(targetOS)/bin` into the Pd externals directory.

## Creating your own standalone project
The setup guide and examples for creating standalone project will be ready soon.
